      <h2>Educational Experience</h2>
    <section class="card-about">
      <p>
        Hi, everyone! My name is Lyudmila. I moved to Israel from Russia a year
        ago. In Russia during my final years at school I was fortunate enough to
        take part in the English language competition after which I was enrolled
        in The Private Educational Center <a href="https://stavdeti.ru/" target="_blank">"POISK"</a>. Three years' study in this Center was one of the most rewarding experiences while at school. During my years in the Center I took an Intensive FCE test preparation course. After I graduated from the Center I continued to study English on my own. A couple of years later I decided to study Psychology and entered <a href="https://idnk.ru/" target="_blank">The Caucases Peoples' Friendship Institute</a>. Through the learning of the basics of psychology I developed my soft skills that I had found very useful in my career of an English language tutor. After 6 years of studying I graduated from The institute with honors. After making aliya I started a half-year Hebrew language course in the Ulpan and succesfully finished it in February this year. Now I am here - in Israel and I am learning to code in <a href="https://www.itc.tech/" target="_blank">ITC's</a> Fullstack Development program.

      <h2>Career Experience</h2>
    <section class="card-about"> 
      <p>
        When I was 17 and I was graduated both from high school and from the
        Center "POISK" I realized that I am extremly fond of English and soon I
        started my career as an <b>English language tutor</b>. In the
        teaching I used differnt methods like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_approach#:~:text=Structural%20approach%20is%20an%20approach,%2C%20and%20vocabulary%2C%20among%20others." target="_blank">Structural approach</a>, <a href="https://www.readingrockets.org/article/what-differentiated-instruction" target="_blank" >Differentiated Instruction</a> and <a href="https://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/article/tbl#:~:text=Task%2Dbased%20learning%20is%20an,to%20stay%20with%20their%20teacher." target="_blank">Task Based Learning</a>. As a tutor I provided an individual, tailored educational programs for each of my pupils and moreover, I was changing my style of teaching to suit their different learning styles. My teaching background is more than 15 years. <br> After moving to Israel I worked as a <b>club coordinator</b> in Amigour company. I was responsibe for organizating holiday celebrations like Purim, Pesach and ceremonies on Holocost Rememberance Day, Victory Day and other events. But I quit my job because I am highly motivated for a career change goal.

      <h2>Coding</h2>
    <section class="card-about">  
      <p>
        Not so long ago I realized that programming isn't boring but exciting.
        Coding allows people to get together to build something unique. Creating
        something meaningful that will be productively used by another person is
        exhilarating. Coding gives power to create whatever design you have in
        your mind using only your computer and the Internet. And ideas are
        changing the world and shaping the future. That's why I desided to
        launch my career in the High-Tech field.

    <section class="card-about">
      <p>
        As I mentioned befor I like travelling so let me tell you a little bit how much I've travelled: I was born in a small town called <b>Budyonnovsk</b> in Russia. In my childhood almost every summer I went to the Black sea for holidays. And every summer I visited a new seaside town. The most impressive towns were: 
        <ul>
          <li><b>Gelendzhik</b></li>
          <li><b>Sochi</b></li>
          <li><b>Adler</b></li>
        </ul> 
        After marriage I moved to the resort city in the south of Russia called <b>Krasnodar</b>. A year ago I moved to Israel. So now I live in <b>Petah-Tikva</b>.
